# TFWS : Tweaks For Weak Systems - Written in C#
 TFWS aims to speed up Windows operating systems on weak systems.

 <p>This program consists of scripts that can help speed up your system. It can also tell you what each of these scripts does and how running them helps to speed up your system.</p>

<p>The idea for TFWS came to me when my system was running slow on Windows 10. I made changes to Service.msc, registry, etc. to speed up my system.
I decided to implement the instructions for speeding up Windows 10 in one program that would enable or disable any part I wanted as soon as possible.I wrote this program for Windows 10 with the knowledge I had of C# so that everyone could speed up their system with a few clicks.</p>

<p>TFWS currently has only 2 tools that I plan to increase. In addition to the main goal, I want to add options to modify Windows 10 so that the user can optimize and personalize Windows 10 as much as possible.Along with all this, guide you in personalizing and optimizing own system.<p>

<p>I uploaded this project as open source in GitHub so that anyone interested in developing this project can be involved in its development and improvement. :)</p>
